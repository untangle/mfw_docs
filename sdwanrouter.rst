SD WAN Router Documentation
===========================

Welcome to the SD-WAN Router documentation.  The Untangle SD-WAN Router is a lightweight,
network edge solution that includes two key capabilities

- advanced routing capabilities to deliver optimized
- a built-in, intelligent firewall to ensure the network is always secure.

Used in conjunction with Untangle NG Firewall, the SD-WAN Router gives the ability to set up a Software
Defined Networking solution across one, or multiple offices providing an always connected, always secure solution.

The SD-WAN Router used advanced, configurable routing techniques to ensure that traffic is sent across
the local network and over the internet in the most efficient manner. When performance matters most,
such as for business-critical but bandwidth-intensive applications, network traffic is accelerated.

Untangle's SD-WAN Router comes with an intelligent firewall and Untangle's proprietary Predicative
Routing services. With application recognition done at the network layer, first packet routing decisions
can be made, essentially at line speed without the overhead of the application layer.
